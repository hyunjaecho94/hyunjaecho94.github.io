I'm a MS student in computer science at University of Virginia, advised by [Prof. Madhur Behl](http://www.madhurbehl.com/). My research revolves around interpretable AI. In particular, I study how to accurately evaluate the safety of autonomous vehicles and explain their behaviors by using natural language processing and computer vision. Prior to joining UVa, I received my Bachelor's degree in computer science at UC Berkeley.

Interests: Machine Learning, Bioinformatics

Research
======
The main metric of safety evaluation of autonomous vehicles has been “miles per intervention” — the number of miles a car can drive autonomously before a safety driver has to take over the car. However, this metric is not ideal because companies test/drive their autonomous vehicles in different environments. Therefore, I study a way to more accurately compare safety of autonomous cars. Using a simulator, it becomes possible to compare autonomous vehicles in a given setting. Using reinforcement learning, I evaluate how different factors, such as the behavior of non-autonomous vehicles, the weather, and time of day, can affect the behavior of self-driving vehicles, namely Apollo by Baidu.

In Fall 2019, I began my bioinformatics research at [DataBio](http://databio.org/). At DataBio, I am trying to accurately transform transcription factor binding sites (tfbs) from biological experiments into a vector embedding space, which is widely used in the field of natural langauge processing. In addition, our team is trying to develop innovative algorithms to be able to determine the relationship between pairs of tfbs. The applications of this research is significant, including the comparison of bedfiles (bedfiles contain tfbs information) between two biological experiements as well as a new perspective of understanding the interconnections of tfbs.
