I'm a MS student in computer science at University of Virginia, advised by Prof. Madhur Behl. My research revolves around interpretable AI. In particular, I study how to accurately evaluate the safety of autonomous vehicles and explain their behaviors by using natural language processing and computer vision. Prior to joining UVa, I received my Bachelor's degree in computer science at UC Berkeley.

The main metric of safety evaluation of autonomous vehicles is “miles per intervention” — the number of miles a car can drive autonomously before a safety driver has to take over the car. However, this metric is not ideal because companies test/drive their autonomous vehicles in different environments. Therefore, I study a way to more accurately compare safety of autonomous cars. Using a simulator, it becomes possible to compare autonomous vehicles in a given setting.
