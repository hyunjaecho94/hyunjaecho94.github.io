HELLO!
======
I'm a Master's (MS) student in computer science at University of Virginia, advised by [Prof. Madhur Behl](http://www.madhurbehl.com/). My research project is titled, "<[Towards Automated Safety Coverage and Testing for Autonomous Vehicles](HyunJae_MS_THESIS.pdf)>". This project is about discovering edge cases in which Baidu Apollo's self-driving algorithm will fail to drive safely. To accomplish this, I am using reinforcement learning and a photo-realistic driving simulator developed by LG Silicon Valley Lab. Take a look at a recent talk I gave about it <[slides](thesis-presentation.pdf)>. In it, I introduce the edge cases of driving scenarios I generated where Apollo had trouble driving safely.

In addition to my work with Prof. Behl, I am also a member of Sheffield lab of computational biology: [[DataBio](http://databio.org/)].

Prior to joining UVa, I received my Bachelor's degree in computer science at UC Berkeley.

Interests: Machine Learning, Bioinformatics

Research
======
The main metric of safety evaluation of autonomous vehicles has been “miles per intervention” — the number of miles a car can drive autonomously before a human driver has to take over the car. However, this metric is not ideal because companies test/drive their autonomous vehicles in different environments. Therefore, I study a way to more accurately assess the safety of autonomous cars. Using a simulator, it becomes possible to compare autonomous vehicles in a given setting. Using reinforcement learning, I evaluate how different factors, such as road geometry, behaviors of non-autonomous vehicles, weather, traffic signals, and time of day, can affect the behavior of self-driving vehicles. In particular, I am using Baidu's Apollo as my self-driving vehicle, which is [open-source](https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo).

In Fall 2019, I began my bioinformatics research at DataBio. At DataBio, our team is trying to accurately transform transcription factor binding sites (tfbs) from biological experiments into a vector embedding space, which is widely used in the field of natural langauge processing. We believe that this way of representing regions on chromosomes will allow us to develop innovative algorithms to determine the relationship between pairs of tfbs.
