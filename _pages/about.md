HELLO!
======
I’m a Ph.D. student in computer science at the University of Virginia (UVA), advised by [Prof. Aidong Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=O8XxkE4AAAAJ&hl=en). My research is at the intersection of biology and machine learning, sharing an overlap with bioinformatics. It is on separating dataset-invariant information from dataset-variant information on medical datasets. Specifically, the two machine learning methods I use are transfer learning and adversarial learning. The eventual goal is to use the information to improve the current state of morbidity prediction. We are currently working with cancer and Alzheimer’s Disease datasets.

I completed by Master’s degree in computer science at UVA, and was fortunate to have [Prof. Madhur Behl](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=bj_imaYAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). My thesis was titled "<[Towards Automated Safety Coverage and Testing for Autonomous Vehicles](HyunJae_MS_THESIS.pdf)>". This project was about discovering edge cases in which Baidu Apollo's self-driving algorithm (version 5.0) will fail to drive safely. To accomplish this, I used reinforcement learning and a photo-realistic driving simulator developed by LG Silicon Valley Lab. Take a look at a talk I gave about it <[slides](thesis-presentation.pdf)>. In it, I introduce the edge cases of driving scenarios I generated where Apollo had trouble driving safely.

In addition to my work with Prof. Behl, I was also a member of Sheffield lab of computational biology: [[DataBio](http://databio.org/)], where we published Bedshift: perturbation of genomic interval sets (as of Dec. 2020 - currently under a delayed review at [Genome Biology](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.11.378554v1) due to Covid-19).

Prior to joining UVA, I received my Bachelor's degree in computer science at UC Berkeley.

Interests: Machine Learning, Bioinformatics

Prior Research
======
Towards Automated Safety Coverage and Testing for Autonomous Vehicles (Master’s degree thesis)

The main metric of safety evaluation of autonomous vehicles has been “miles per intervention” — the number of miles a car can drive autonomously before a human driver has to take over the car. However, this metric is not ideal because companies test/drive their autonomous vehicles in different environments. Therefore, I studied a way to more accurately assess the safety of autonomous cars. Using reinforcement learning on the LGSVL simulator, I evaluated how different factors, such as road geometry, behaviors of non-autonomous vehicles, weather, traffic signals, and time of day, can affect the behavior of self-driving vehicles. In particular, I used Baidu's Apollo 5.0 as my self-driving vehicle, which is [open-source](https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo).


Transcription Factor Binding Site Prediction

In Fall 2019, I did my bioinformatics research at DataBio. At DataBio, our team is trying to accurately transform transcription factor binding sites (tfbs) from biological experiments into a vector embedding space, which is widely used in the field of natural language processing. We believe that this way of representing regions on chromosomes will allow us to develop innovative algorithms to determine the relationship between pairs of tfbs.

“Bedshift: perturbation of genomic interval sets” provides a Python API and a command line tool for generating new BED files (Browser Extensible Data) with desired random perturbations such as shifting, adding, and dropping transcription sites from existing BED files.
